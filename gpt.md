This assignment is quite comprehensive, involving multiple aspects of software quality, security, and data management. Here are some pointers and suggestions to help you get started and ensure you cover all required aspects:

### 1. **Setup and Initial Design**
- **Project Structure**: Organize your project into clear directories and files. For instance, have separate directories for database operations, user management, member management, logging, and encryption.
- **Environment**: Ensure you use Python 3 and the specified libraries (`sqlite3`, `re`, and any asynchronous cryptography/hash library).

### 2. **Database Design**
- **Tables**:
  - `users`: Stores user details (username, password hash, role, profile info).
  - `members`: Stores member details.
  - `logs`: Stores activity logs.
- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Use asymmetric encryption for sensitive data such as usernames, addresses, and phone numbers. Libraries like `cryptography` (PyCA) provide robust tools for this.

### 3. **User Authentication and Authorization**
- **Hardcoded Super Admin**: Implement the super admin with hardcoded credentials.
- **Password Management**: Use a library like `bcrypt` or `argon2` for hashing passwords. Ensure passwords are not stored in plaintext.
- **Roles and Permissions**: Implement role-based access control to differentiate permissions for super admins, system admins, and consultants.

### 4. **Input Validation**
- **Validation Functions**: Implement functions to validate user inputs for all forms (registration, login, etc.). Use regular expressions to validate email, phone numbers, and other fields.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database safely.

### 5. **User Interface**
- **Console-based UI**: Design a menu-driven interface for navigation. Use clear prompts and feedback messages to guide the user.

### 6. **Logging**
- **Activity Logs**: Log all activities with details like date, time, username, description, and whether the activity is suspicious.
- **Log Encryption**: Ensure logs are encrypted and only accessible via the system interface.

### 7. **Encryption and Hashing Libraries**
- **Hashing Passwords**: `bcrypt`, `argon2_cffi`
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: `cryptography` library in Python provides tools for RSA and other algorithms.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: For encrypting larger data sets (like logs), you might use symmetric encryption methods (e.g., AES) while managing keys securely.

### 8. **Handling Invalid Inputs and Errors**
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Ensure that your application can handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.
- **User Feedback**: Provide meaningful error messages to the user without revealing sensitive system information.

### 9. **Backup and Restore**
- **Database Backup**: Implement functions to backup and restore the database and logs. Ensure the backup files are securely handled.
- **Zip Format**: Use Pythonâ€™s `zipfile` module to create and manage backup files.

### 10. **Security Best Practices**
- **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injections and other attacks.
- **Encryption Keys Management**: Securely manage encryption keys, potentially using environment variables or secure storage solutions.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your libraries and dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.

### Common Pitfalls to Watch Out For:
1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Apart from the required super admin, avoid hardcoding any other credentials or sensitive information.
2. **Plaintext Storage**: Never store sensitive data, especially passwords, in plaintext.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that your application handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users.
4. **Security Oversights**: Regularly review your code for security vulnerabilities, especially in areas handling user inputs and database interactions.
5. **Documentation**: Maintain good documentation for your code to help during the presentation and for any future maintenance.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Initial Setup**: Create the database schema and set up the project structure.
2. **Authentication System**: Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control.
3. **Member Management**: Implement CRUD operations for managing member data.
4. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated before processing.
5. **Logging System**: Implement logging of activities with proper encryption.
6. **Backup and Restore**: Implement functionality for backing up and restoring the database and logs.
7. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your application for functionality and security.

By following these guidelines and systematically implementing each part of the system, you will be able to meet the requirements of the assignment and create a secure and efficient member management system.
